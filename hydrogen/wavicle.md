## Wavicle 

Light is a *wavicle*. \
A *wavicle* is a particle that exhibits both wave and particle properties, functioning with *wave-particle duality*. 

The wave-like properties of light: 
- Diffraction 
- Interference 
- Superposition 

The particle-like properties of light: 
- Photons 
- Quantization 
- Compton Scattering 

## Light Creation 

Light is created when an *electron* releases energy in the form of *photons*. This occurs when an electron moves from a *high energy state* to a *lower energy state* and excess energy is released. 

Stages of light creation: 
1. Excitation: When an atom absorbs energy, an electron can move from a lower-energy orbital to a higher-energy one if the right amount of energy is absorbed. 
2. De-excitation: The electron is unstable in higher-energy orbitals due to its increased distance from the nucleus, causing the kinetic energy of the electron to increase, as well as quantum mechanical factors(?). The electron will return back to a lower-energy orbital with time. During this transition, the electron releases the excess energy from moving between orbitals in the form of photons (a particle of light). 

Moving between orbitals (in either direction) takes a specific amount of energy because the energy levels in an atom are quantized. This means that electrons can only occupy discrete energy states, and the difference in energy between these states determines the amount of energy needed for a transition. This is proven by Bohr's atomic model and the Schrödinger Equation(?). The energy of the photon corresponds to the difference between the two energy levels of the transitioned from orbitals. The energy of the photon is also related to its frequency and wavelength.

c=3\cdot10^8,m/s \\[gap:10px]
∆E=13.6,eV\left(\frac{1}{n_{low}^2}-\frac{1}{n_{high}^2}\right)
$$ 

Example (Hydrogen)
$$
∆E=13.6,eV\left(\frac{1}{n_{low}^2}-\frac{1}{n_{high}^2}\right) \\[gap:10px]
∆E=13.6,eV\left(\frac{1}{n_{low}^2}-\frac{1}{n_{high}^2}\right) \\[gap:10px]
$$

$ ∆E=E_{final}-E_{initial} $ \
For Hydrogen:\
$ E_n=-\frac{13.6,eV}{n_2} $


## Properties of a Photon

The energy of the Photon determines its wavelength and frequency. This determines velocity as well as the emitted light color. 

$ E=fh $

Where $h$ is plank's constant. 

## Energy 

Energy is the capacity to produce a change or event. It is a fundamental property of objects and systems. Energy can neither be created or destroyed, only transferred from one form to another, as described by *the law of conservation of energy*.
