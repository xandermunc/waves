            <p class="paragraph">The Glossary of Light and Sound is an interactive resource for understanding the
                basics of the wave science of Light and Sound. It is a tool for beginners and curious learners to
                explore the phenomena of the beautiful world of waves around them.
            </p>
            <h1 class="section-title">What are Waves?</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Waves are patterns of moving energy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Waves move energy from one place to another, like ripples running on water or sound traveling through
                air.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Light is a wave, and sound is a wave.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Some waves transport energy by moving through matter, traveling through different mediums such as air,
                water,
                or
                solids. But, other waves can even move through empty space.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Understanding waves is the key to understanding how we perceive the world around us, from the light we
                see,
                to
                the sounds we hear, to the force that holds us to our planet.</p>
            <h1 class="section-title">The Anatomy of a Wave</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Waves are made of their fundamental properties, which define how they function and interact with the
                world.
                The
                four properties of waves we will look at first are amplitude, frequency, velocity, and wavelength.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Amplitude</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Amplitude is the wave's maximum displacement, the higher the amplitude, the more energy the wave carries.
                The
                energy of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude. It is measured in various units
                depending
                on
                the type of wave.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In light, amplitude affects intensity or brightness. It is commonly measured in electric field strength
                (Volts
                per meter, V/m).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In sound, amplitude corresponds to loudness and is expressed as pressure. It is measured in decibels
                (dB),
                which
                represents perceived loudness on a logarithmic scale.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Frequency</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a second. It is measured in hertz (Hz)
                where
                one hertz equals one cycle per second. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths as frequency
                and
                wavelength are inversely proportional.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In light, frequency is relative to color. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths, resulting
                in
                cooler colors like blue and violet, while lower frequencies correspond to longer wavelengths, producing
                warmer
                colors like red and orange.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In sound, frequency determines pitch, measured by the number of vibrations of a sound wave per second in
                hertz.
                Higher frequencies produce high-pitched sounds, while lower frequencies produce low-pitched ones.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Velocity</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Velocity is the speed of a wave. The measurement of a wave's velocity varies depending on the type of
                wave
                and
                the medium being propagated.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The speed of light waves through a medium. In a vacuum, it is about 300,000 kilometers per second,
                slowing in
                denser materials like water or glass.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The speed of sound waves is influenced by the medium's density and elasticity. In air, the speed is about
                343
                meters per second, and it is generally faster in solids and liquids.</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Wavelength</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points on a wave. Waves with shorter wavelengths carry
                more
                energy than those with longer ones. Higher wavelengths correspond to shorter frequencies as wavelength
                and
                frequency are inversely proportional.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In light, wavelength determines color. Shorter wavelengths produce cooler colors, while longer
                wavelengths
                create
                warmer ones. Higher-energy lightwaves, those with shorter wavelengths, produce higher temperatures as
                they
                are
                more energetic. For example, blue stars are much hotter than red stars.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In sound, wavelength is relative to pitch with typical wavelengths in air spanning from a few centimeters
                for
                high-pitched sounds, to several meters for lower-pitched ones. In music, a high note has a much shorter
                wavelength than one a few octaves lower.</p>
            <h1 class="section-title">The Equation <span class="inter">v=fλ</span></h1>
            <p class="paragraph">The relationship between velocity, frequency, and wavelength is represented by the equation v=fλ. It
                shows
                that
                the speed of a wave is equal to its frequency multiplied by its wavelength. This creates a connection
                between
                how fast a wave moves and its shape-related properties. This equation is universal, applying to all
                types of
                waves, and illustrates how these properties interact with each other.</p>
