# The Glossary of Light and Sound 

## Overview 

The Glossary is a guide through the basics of the wave sciences of Light and Sound. It is a tool for beginners and curious learners to explore the phenomena of the beautiful world of waves around them.  

## What are Waves? 

> Wave Definition 

Waves are patterns of moving energy.

Waves move energy from one place to another, like ripples on water or sound traveling through air.

Light is a wave, and sound is a wave.

A wave is a repeating vibration that transfers energy from one place to another. Some waves do this by moving their energy through matter, traveling through different mediums like air, water, or solids. And some waves can even move through empty space.

Understanding waves is the key to understanding how we perceive the world around us, from the light we see, to the sounds we hear, to the force that holds us to our planet. 

## Properties of waves 

> Anatomy of a Wave 

Waves are made of their fundamental properties, which define how they function and interact with the world and each other. 

- Wavelength 
- Amplitude 
- Frequency 
- Velocity 

*TOOL or ANIMATION* 

The repeating vibration of a wave is called an oscillation. The direction of the wave’s movement through space is called the wave’s propagation. The relationship between oscillation and propagation depends on the type of wave. 

## Types of waves 

- Transverse
- Longitudinal
- Electromagnetic 
- Mechanical 

Waves are classified into two main categories: Transverse Waves and Longitudinal Waves. In Transverse Waves, the oscillation occurs perpendicular to the direction of wave's propagation. This means that Transverse Waves move energy perpendicularly to the direction that they are traveling in. Longitudinal Waves are the opposite, moving energy in the same direction as the their direction of propagation. 

Waves are classified into two main categories: Transverse Waves and Longitudinal Waves. In Transverse Waves, the oscillation occurs perpendicular to the direction of wave's propagation. This means that Transverse Waves move energy up and down, or side to side, at 90 degrees, when the wave is traveling forward. Longitudinal Waves are the opposite, moving energy in the same direction as the their direction of propagation.

## Light 

### The nature of light 

Light is an *electromagnetic* wave 
Light can also behave as a particle (*photon*) / Wave-particle duality
We perceive the *visible spectrum* of light

### Light wave properties 

*Wavelength* determines *color*
The *intensity* of light is proportional to the amplitude squared 
Speed of light and its significance
Light travels at different speeds through different mediums (*dispersion*) 

### Light examples 

Vision, cameras, fiber optics, solar energy.
Telescopes, microscopes, lasers.

### Light phenomena

Light is effected by *diffraction* (Huygens’ principle)
Light is effected by *interference*

Visualizing wave behavior (e.g., reflection, refraction).

## Sound 

### The nature of sound 

Sound is a *mechanical* wave 
Sound requires a *medium* to *propagate*
Sound waves consist of *compressions* and *rarefractions* in *pressure* 
Sound waves are *longitudinal* (particle motion is parallel to wave direction)

### Sound wave properties

*Frequency* determines pitch 
*Loudness* is determined by amplitude 
Speed of sound and its significance
Sound travels at different speeds through different mediums (*dispersion*) 

### Sound examples 

Everyday examples: Music, communication, sonar.
Science: Ultrasound, soundproofing, acoustics.

### Sound phenomena

*Resonance* and *oscillations* occur when sound waves match *natural frequencies* of objects

### Speed differences 

Comparison of speed, mediums, and propagation.
