    <h1>The Glossary of Light and Sound</h1>
    <p>The Glossary of Light and Sound is an interactive resource for understanding the basics of the wave science of
        Light and Sound. It is a tool for beginners and curious learners to explore the phenomena of the beautiful world
        of waves around them.</p>
    <h2>What are Waves?</h2>
    <p>Waves are patterns of moving energy.</p>
    <p>Waves move energy from one place to another, like ripples running on water or sound traveling through air.</p>
    <p>Light is a wave, and sound is a wave.</p>
    <p>Some waves transport energy by moving through matter, traveling through different mediums such as air, water, or
        solids. But, other waves can even move through empty space.</p>
    <p>Understanding waves is the key to understanding how we perceive the world around us, from the light we see, to
        the sounds we hear, to the force that holds us to our planet.</p>
    <h2>The Anatomy of a Wave</h2>
    <p>Waves are made of their fundamental properties, which define how they function and interact with the world. The
        four properties of waves we will look at first are amplitude, frequency, velocity, and wavelength.</p>
    <h3>Amplitude</h3>
    <p>Amplitude is the wave's maximum displacement, the higher the amplitude, the more energy the wave carries. The
        energy of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude. It is measured in various units depending on
        the type of wave.</p>
    <p>In light, amplitude affects intensity or brightness. It is commonly measured in electric field strength (Volts
        per meter, V/m).</p>
    <p>In sound, amplitude corresponds to loudness and is expressed as pressure. It is measured in decibels (dB), which
        represents perceived loudness on a logarithmic scale.</p>
    <h3>Frequency</h3>
    <p>Frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a second. It is measured in hertz (Hz) where
        one hertz equals one cycle per second. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths as frequency and
        wavelength are inversely proportional.</p>
    <p>In light, frequency is relative to color. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths, resulting in
        cooler colors like blue and violet, while lower frequencies correspond to longer wavelengths, producing warmer
        colors like red and orange.</p>
    <p>In sound, frequency determines pitch, measured by the number of vibrations of a sound wave per second in hertz.
        Higher frequencies produce high-pitched sounds, while lower frequencies produce low-pitched ones.</p>
    <h3>Velocity</h3>
    <p>Velocity is the speed of a wave. The measurement of a wave's velocity varies depending on the type of wave and
        the medium being propagated.</p>
    <p>The speed of light waves through a medium. In a vacuum, it is about 300,000 kilometers per second, slowing in
        denser materials like water or glass.</p>
    <p>The speed of sound waves is influenced by the medium's density and elasticity. In air, the speed is about 343
        meters per second, and it is generally faster in solids and liquids.</p>
    <h3>Wavelength</h3>
    <p>Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points on a wave. Waves with shorter wavelengths carry more
        energy than those with longer ones. Higher wavelengths correspond to shorter frequencies as wavelength and
        frequency are inversely proportional.</p>
    <p>In light, wavelength determines color. Shorter wavelengths produce cooler colors, while longer wavelengths create
        warmer ones. Higher-energy lightwaves, those with shorter wavelengths, produce higher temperatures as they are
        more energetic. For example, blue stars are much hotter than red stars.</p>
    <p>In sound, wavelength is relative to pitch with typical wavelengths in air spanning from a few centimeters for
        high-pitched sounds, to several meters for lower-pitched ones. In music, a high note has a much shorter
        wavelength than one a few octaves lower.</p>
    <h3>The Equation v=fλ</h3>
    <p>The relationship between velocity, frequency, and wavelength is represented by the equation v=fλ. It shows that
        the speed of a wave is equal to its frequency multiplied by its wavelength. This creates a connection between
        how fast a wave moves and its shape-related properties. This equation is universal, applying to all types of
        waves, and illustrates how these properties interact with each other.</p>
