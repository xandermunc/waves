                    displacement, the higher the
                    amplitude, the more energy the wave carries. The energy of the wave is proportional to the square of

                represented by the equation v=fλ. It shows that the speed of a wave is equal to its frequency multiplied

                properties. This equation is universal, applying to all types of waves, and illustrates how these

Higher wavelengths correspond to shorter frequencies as wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional.<br><br> In light, wavelength determines color. Shorter wavelengths produce cooler colors, while longer wavelengths create warmer ones. Higher-energy lightwaves, those with shorter wavelengths, produce higher temperatures as they are more energetic. For example, blue stars are much hotter than red stars. <br><br>In sound, wavelength is relative to pitch with typical wavelengths in air spanning from a few centimeters for high-pitched sounds, to several meters for lower-pitched ones.
