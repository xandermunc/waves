## What are Waves? 

Waves are dynamic patterns of moving energy.
Waves are dynamic patterns that transfer energy. !!!
(Waves are dynamic patterns that transfer energy through a medium or space.)
(Without "dynamic," saying "waves are patterns" might imply a fixed or stationary structure, like a frozen ripple in water. But waves are disturbances that propagate (move) and transfer energy, making them inherently dynamic.)
(The word "dynamic" is important because it emphasizes that waves are not static—they involve continuous movement and change over time.)
(For example:
Sound waves are vibrations that move through air.
Water waves are oscillations that travel across a surface.
Light waves are electromagnetic disturbances that propagate through space.
By including "dynamic," your definition correctly reflects the active and time-dependent nature of waves.)
(Waves transfer energy, but the individual particles (in mechanical waves like sound or water) or the fields (in electromagnetic waves like light) oscillate in place rather than moving with the wave.
The wave pattern moves, but in many cases, the energy does not physically flow like a moving object—it is transferred through interactions between particles or fields.)

Waves move energy from one place to another, like ripples running on water or sound traveling through air.

Light is a wave, and sound is a wave.
(Light behaves like a wave, and sound is a wave.)

Some waves transport energy by moving through matter, traveling through different mediums such as air, water, or solids. But, other waves can even move through empty space.

Understanding waves is the key to understanding how we perceive the world around us, from the light we see, to the sounds we hear, to the force that holds us to our planet.

Waves are dynamic patterns that transfer energy.

This is a complicated thought to describe a complicated process. Let's start by simplifying this sentence and defining what it means.  

Waves are dynamic patterns...

Waves are a repeating, structured motion that move in space and time. This means that if you observe a wave over time, you’ll see recurring features. They are dynamic because they move and change with time and are not a static structure. 

Waves transfer energy...

Some waves transfer energy by traveling through matter, causing particles in a medium, such as air, water, or solids, to move back and forth as the wave passes through. While other waves can even transfer energy through empty space.

## The Anatomy of a Wave 

Waves are made of their fundamental properties, which define how they function and interact with the world. The four properties of waves we will look at first are amplitude, frequency, velocity, and wavelength. 

### Amplitude 

Amplitude is the wave's maximum displacement, the higher the amplitude, the more energy the wave carries. The energy of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude. It is measured in various units depending on the type of wave. 

In light, amplitude affects intensity or brightness. It is commonly measured in electric field strength (Volts per meter, V/m).

In sound, amplitude corresponds to loudness and is expressed as pressure. It is measured in decibels (dB), which represents perceived loudness on a logarithmic scale.

### Frequency 

Frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a given point in a second. It is measured in hertz (Hz) where one hertz equals one cycle per second. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths as frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional.

In light, frequency is relative to color. Higher frequencies correspond to shorter wavelengths, resulting in cooler colors like blue and violet, while lower frequencies correspond to longer wavelengths, producing warmer colors like red and orange.

In sound, frequency determines pitch, measured by the number of vibrations of a sound wave per second in hertz. Higher frequencies produce high-pitched sounds, while lower frequencies produce low-pitched ones.

### Velocity 

Velocity is the speed of a wave. The measurement of a wave's velocity varies depending on the type of wave and the medium being propagated. 

The speed of light waves through a medium. In a vacuum, it is about 300,000 kilometers per second, slowing in denser materials like water or glass.

The speed of sound waves is influenced by the medium's density and elasticity. In air, the speed is about 343 meters per second, and it is generally faster in solids and liquids.

### Wavelength 

Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points on a wave. Waves with shorter wavelengths carry more energy than those with longer ones. Higher wavelengths correspond to shorter frequencies as wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional. 

In light, wavelength determines color. Shorter wavelengths produce cooler colors, while longer wavelengths create warmer ones. Higher-energy lightwaves, those with shorter wavelengths, produce higher temperatures as they are more energetic. For example, blue stars are much hotter than red stars.

In sound, wavelength is relative to pitch with typical wavelengths in air spanning from a few centimeters for high-pitched sounds, to several meters for lower-pitched ones. In music, a high note has a much shorter wavelength than one a few octaves lower. 


### The Equation v=fλ

The relationship between velocity, frequency, and wavelength is represented by the equation v=fλ. It shows that the speed of a wave is equal to its frequency multiplied by its wavelength. This creates a connection between how fast a wave moves and its shape-related  properties. This equation is universal, applying to all types of waves, and illustrates how these properties interact with each other. 

## Types of waves 

The repeating vibration of a wave is called an oscillation. And the direction of the wave’s movement through space is called the wave’s propagation. The relationship between oscillation and propagation depends on the type of wave. 

- Transverse
- Longitudinal
- Electromagnetic 
- Mechanical 
compressions or rarefactions
crests and troughths

Waves are classified into two main categories: Transverse Waves and Longitudinal Waves. In Transverse Waves, the oscillation occurs perpendicular to the direction of wave's propagation. This means that Transverse Waves move energy perpendicularly to the direction that they are traveling in. 

Waves are classified into two main categories: Transverse Waves and Longitudinal Waves. In Transverse Waves, the oscillation occurs perpendicular to the direction of wave's propagation. This means that Transverse Waves move energy up and down, or side to side, at 90 degrees, when the wave is traveling forward. Longitudinal Waves are the opposite, moving energy in the same direction as the their direction of propagation. 

*ANIMATION*

Longitudinal Waves are the opposite, moving energy in the same direction as the their direction of propagation.

1. Light: Wavelength Determines Color
Light is an electromagnetic wave, meaning it can travel through a vacuum and does not need a medium.
In a vacuum, the speed of light is constant (≈ 299,792,458 m/s), so wavelength and frequency are directly linked by the equation:
c=λf
Where:
c is the speed of light (constant in a vacuum).
λ (wavelength) and 
f (frequency) are inversely related.
Since the speed of light is fixed in a vacuum, color is usually described in terms of wavelength, because that's what our eyes detect best.
When light moves through materials like glass or water, its speed changes, meaning its wavelength changes while its frequency remains constant. That’s another reason color is typically linked to wavelength.
2. Sound: Frequency Determines Pitch
Sound is a mechanical wave, meaning it needs a medium (like air, water, or solids) to propagate.
The speed of sound depends on the medium (e.g., sound travels faster in water than in air).
However, when sound moves between media, its frequency stays the same while its wavelength changes—because the speed of sound is different in different materials.
Our ears perceive pitch based on frequency, not wavelength, because our auditory system detects how many wave cycles reach our ears per second, rather than the spatial length of the wave.
Key Difference: What Stays Constant?
For light, frequency stays constant when changing media, so we define color by wavelength.
For sound, wavelength changes when changing media, so we define pitch by frequency.
Summary:
Light: Wavelength determines color because frequency is constant when light enters a different medium.
Sound: Frequency determines pitch because it directly correlates with what our ears perceive, while wavelength varies with the medium.

Wave Relationship Recap
The relationship among wave speed (
v
v), wavelength (
λ
λ), and frequency (
f
f) is given by the equation:

v=λf
Where:

v
v = speed of the wave
λ
λ = wavelength
f
f = frequency
What Happens When Light Enters a New Medium?
Change in Speed:
When light enters a denser medium (like glass from air), it slows down. This is due to the interaction of light with the atoms in the glass, which causes delays in the propagation of the wave.
Wavelength Changes:
Since the wave speed (
v
v) decreases in the new medium, and because frequency (
f
f) is determined by the source of the light and does not change, the wavelength (
λ
λ) must adjust to maintain the relationship 
v
=
λ
f
v=λf.
In this case, since 
v
v decreases, 
λ
λ must also decrease to satisfy the equation, leading to a shorter wavelength in the glass.
Constant Frequency:
The frequency of the wave is determined by the source of the wave (e.g., an oscillating electron in an atom that emits light). This source generates the wave at a specific frequency.
When light transitions from air to glass, the number of oscillations (cycles) per second produced by the source remains the same. Therefore, the frequency does not change.
Inversely Proportional Relationship:
While wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional (as one increases, the other decreases), it is crucial to remember that they depend on the speed of the wave as well.
The relationship is maintained by the equation 
v
=
λ
f
v=λf. When the wave enters a new medium:
Speed decreases → Wavelength decreases
Frequency stays constant
Example:
In air, suppose the speed of light is 
c

  m/s), and the wavelength of red light is

700 nm:
c

λ
f
c=λf gives a frequency 
f
f.
When light enters glass, its speed decreases (let's say to 
2.00
×
1
0
8
2.00×10 
8
  m/s), and the wavelength must adjust accordingly:
\text{New speed in glass} = \text{New wavelength} \times \text{Same frequency} ]
Since speed decreases and frequency remains constant, the wavelength must also decrease to keep the equation balanced.
Conclusion:
In summary, when light slows down as it enters a denser medium like glass, its wavelength decreases to maintain the equation 
v
=
λ
f
v=λf, while its frequency remains constant because it is determined by the source of the wave.
