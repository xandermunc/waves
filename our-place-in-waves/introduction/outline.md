# The Glossary of Light and Sound

## Overview 

Wave definition 
Examples of waves 

Properties of waves 
- Amplitude 
- Wavelength 
- Frequency 
- Period 
- Velocity 

Other vocab 
- Oscitation 
- Phase 
- Space
- Time 

## Light  

### The nature of light 

- Light is an *electromagnetic* wave 
- Light can also behave as a particle (*photon*)
- We perceive the *visible spectrum* of light

### Light wave properties 

*Wavelength* determines *color*
The *intensity* of light is proportional to the amplitude squared 
Light travels at different speeds through different mediums (*dispersion*) 

### Light phenomena

Light is effected by *diffraction* (Huygensâ€™ principle)
Light is effected by *interference*

## Sound 

### The nature of sound 

Sound is a *mechanical* wave 
Sound requires a *medium* to *propagate*
Sound waves consist of *compressions* and *rarefractions* in *pressure* 
Sound waves are *longitudinal* (particle motion is parallel to wave direction)

### Sound wave properties

*Frequency* determines pitch 
*Loudness* is determined by amplitude 
Sound travels at different speeds through different mediums (*dispersion*) 

### Sound phenomena

*Resonance* and *oscillations* occur when sound waves match *natural frequencies* of objects
