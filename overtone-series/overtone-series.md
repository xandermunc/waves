The Overtone Series, also known as the Harmonic Series, is a natural phenomenon in which a single pitch, the fundamental frequency, produces additional harmonic frequencies above it. 

This occurs in all natural forms of sound that can be identified by pitch, as they produce a fundamental frequency.

These overtones occur due to the physical resonant properties of the sound's source, forming the foundation of musical acoustics, timbre, and harmony.
